# Pet-Store
The main goal of this project is:
Use of inheritance and interfaces in java to interact with different classes. This is a pet store where people are able to display the animals that are up for adoption and pick their new adoptee. 
It starts by outputting options for the user to choose from. 
Information is stored in different arrays that represent the inventory(animals), and is placed into a differenet array once a user makes a selection. This program updates every array associated 
with the users choice when they add something from the inventory to their cart. 
The Main Store is where all everything is assembled for the store. There you will see array lists being assembled/declared for use.
